# hapsby
Hapsby is a save state/save game editor for Java compatible platforms. It currently supports over 30 games, adding support for new games is relatively uncomplicated.

I wrote the first version of Hapsby back in spring/summer 2000 as a way to learn Java and cheat at NES/SMS/Genesis RPGs. Yeah, I cheated at a few games. I enjoy console RPGs but don't have time for all the XP/gold grinding. Hapsby was designed to solve this problem. Anyway, after a few iterations I had it working nicely and left it untouched for years. In late 2008 I had the urge to update it. Once I looked at the code I originally duct-taped together I opted for a sizable overhaul. The result was a more usable, and lighter, Hapsby 2.0.
