# hapsby
Hapsby is a save state/save game editor for Java compatible platforms. It currently supports over 30 games, adding support for new games is relatively uncomplicated.

I wrote the first version of Hapsby back in spring/summer 2000 as a way to learn Java and cheat at NES/SMS/Genesis RPGs. Yeah, I cheated at a few games. I enjoy console RPGs but don't have time for all the XP/gold grinding. Hapsby was designed to solve this problem. Anyway, after a few iterations I had it working nicely and left it untouched for years. In late 2008 I had the urge to update it. Once I looked at the code I originally duct-taped together I opted for a sizable overhaul. The result was a more usable, and lighter, Hapsby 2.0. In the spring 2015 of 2015 I upgraded it again to JavaFX.

There are three folders in this repository: 

<b>Hapsby 1.x</b>: The orignal version written in 2000. This is no longer being maintained.

<b>Hapsby 2.x</b>: The second major release written in 2008. This is the version for systems that can not run Java 8+. This is no longer being maintained unless a critical bug is found.

<b>HapsbyFX</b>: This is the current, semi-actively maintained version for Java 8+.
