<p align="left"><font size="3">1. General Questions</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">i. What does 'Hapsby' stand for?</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">This program originally started as a save game editor for the
  Phantasy Star series. While working on the design I decided to create a
  &quot;plug in&quot; system so that future Phantasy Star releases could be
  supported. Adding this feature effectively made it universal save game editor,
  so I scrapped the Phantasy Star editor idea and focused on making this a
  more flexible program.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">Anyways, I decided to honor the original intentions by naming
  it after a character from Phantasy Star. I went with Hapsby for two
  reasons: (1) it was a pretty obscure reference that only die-hard Phantasy
  Star geeks get and (2) Alis, Odin, Myau, and Noah all sounded awful.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="3">ii. Your program destroyed one of of my saved games!</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Well, that's not really a question but....</font> </p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">I warned you to make backups, I even included an auto-backup
feature (it's even turned on by default). But you didn't use it. I have no sympathy for you.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Oh, what's that you say... you didn't know about
the auto-backup feature? Open up index.html in the \docs folder to see
instructions on how to restore a backed-up save game.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="3">iii. I tried editing a save game and nothing
happened!</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">Well, that's not really a question either
  but....</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">Sometimes you have to &quot;refresh&quot; the
  screen before you'll see the changes take effect. For example:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Phantasy Star Series:</b> If you save your
  game on the status screen, then edit the save game with Hapsby, then reload
  the save game you won't see any difference until you exit the status screen
  and re-enter it. Also, if you edit your experience points you won't gain
  levels until after you win your next battle.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Faxandu:</b> This one is especially weird -
  if you edit your experience points you have to go visit a priest before
  gaining levels. If you edit your golds :) you won't see the new value until
  you do something like enter a building or collect a coin.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Legend of Zelda:</b> If you give yourself
  the blue or red ring, Link's color doesn't change. Go get yourself hit a few
  times and you'll see that the ring is in full-effect though. When Link
  actually picks up one of the rings the palette-change event is
  triggered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="3">iv. What's all this GNU General Public License stuff mean?</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">The GNU General Public License is a legal document that allows
  software developers to write free software and distribute it freely. This is
  similar, but <b>not</b> the same as an open source license. For complete
  details read the gpl.html file that was included with this software, or visit <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">gnu.org</a>.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">Basically, you can do anything you want with the code, including sell your new version.  The catch
  is that if you distribute new binary versions, you are required to make the entire source code
  available for free to everyone.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">If you want to redistribute this program on your web site
  please contact the author in advance.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="3">v. When I tried to run Hapsby I received the
error &quot;Exception in thread "main" java.util.zip.ZipException&quot;.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">Under Windows you may receive the following
  error when running the file hapsby.bat:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="1">Exception in thread "main" java.util.zip.ZipException: The system cannot find the file specified<br>
        at java.util.zip.ZipFile.open(Native Method)<br>
        at java.util.zip.ZipFile.&lt;init>(Unknown Source)<br>
        at java.util.jar.JarFile.&lt;init>(Unknown Source)<br>
        at java.util.jar.JarFile.&lt;init>(Unknown Source)</font>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">This is simply a pathing nuisance. I'm not sure
  if this is Window's or Java's fault but it certainly is annoying. To avoid it
  you need to make sure you are actually in the directory containing hapsby.bat
  and not running it from another directory. For example:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Good</b>: C:\hapsby\bin\win32&gt;hapsby.bat</font><p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Bad</b>:
    C:\&gt;hapsby\bin\win32\hapsby.bat</font>

<p align="left"><font size="3">2. Java Runtime</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">** Please note: this is in no way an official reference for
Java, only a brief guide to some common woes. For official documentation
please visit the <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems Java site</a>
**</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">i. Why can't I run Java programs?</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">There are two likely problems:&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">1) You need the newest version of the Java Runtime
  Environment.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">2) Your operating system doesn't have a path set the Java
  bin directory (see next question). Some operating systems (like Windows
  95/98/NT) have problems with the Java Runtime install and don't update
  system PATH variables. This doesn't mean Java is installed incorrectly,
  it's just not being 'pointed to' by the operating system. Please note, Java Runtime
  1.3.0 appears to have this problem completely resolved now.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="3">ii. How do I set my CLASSPATH?</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2">It depends on your operating system. See one of the following
articles:</font></p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/Programming/BasicJava1/windows.html"><font size="2">Setting
the <code>CLASSPATH</code> Environment Variable on the Windows Platform</font></a></p>

  the CLASSPATH</font></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="3">iii. Where is the Java Runtime Environment for
operating system XXXX?</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">The Hapsby homepage contains current links for:
  Windows 95/98/2000/NT4,</font> <font size="2">Linux,</font> &amp; <font size="2">MacOS.
  This page is updated more often than this FAQ so go pay it a visit: <a href="http://www.HuguesJohnson.com/hapsby.html">http://www.HuguesJohnson.com/hapsby.html</a></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2"><b><u>Other Platforms</u></b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Windows CE or XP:</b> Currently <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a>
  does not support these versions of Windows. However, it's very likely that the
  Windows 2000 JRE will work in Windows XP - <b>but do so at your own risk</b>.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>PalmOS:</b> PalmOS 4.0 is fully Java
  compatible.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Unix:</b> There are too many Unix platforms
  for me to even attempt this. It should be obvious that the JRE is available
  for Solaris, but outside of that I can't help.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>BeOS:</b> According to <a href="http://be.com/">be.com</a>
  the JRE for BeOS is under way, nothing's been released yet though. The JRE for
  <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat Linux</a> is built using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">gcc</a>,
  since <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">gcc</a> is also bundled with BeOS it seems
  that someone (not me) could port this code.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Amiga:</b> Just like BeOS, <a href="http://www.amiga.com/">amiga.com</a>
  also promises a JRE for Amiga, but there's no sign of it whatsoever.&nbsp;The
  rights to Amiga were recently sold by <a href="http://www.gateway.com/">Gateway</a>
  to small start-up company. I have heard they are committed to adding Java
  support for the Amiga platform.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Windows NT 3.51: </b>Sorry, outta luck.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>MS-DOS/Windows 3.x:</b>  Go directly to
  jail, do not pass Go, do not collect $200.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="3">iv. Why do .jar files use the WordPad icon?</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">I've wondered this one myself for a while. I
  really don't have any idea. If it's annoying you: open up Windows explorer and
  select &quot;<u>V</u>iew-&gt;Folder <u>O</u>ptions&quot; from the menu (or
  &quot;<u>T</u>ools-&gt;Folder <u>O</u>ptions&quot; depending on what version
  you have). Now click on the &quot;File Types&quot; panel, select the .jar file
  extension, then hit the advanced button and choose a new icon.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">3. Development</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">i. How do I do XXXX in Java?</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2">I'm sorry but I won't answer any Java programming questions. I
worked as a teaching assistant for several years in college, and probably will
again. If you're in one of my classes then I'll
gladly help you, otherwise I won't.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">Please see Sun's Java site (<a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a>)
  for Java programming help. There is a complete Java tutorial and developer's
  forum located there.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="3">ii. I made some changes to your code, do you want them?</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">Probably. If you've made a significant improvement or bug fix
  I'd like to see it. If I end up using it I'll credit your contribution in the
  release.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">Please ask before sending any code, there's a chance that I
  (or someone else) has already made the same change you did.</font> </p>
